This project is a YouTube Script Assistant application built using Streamlit for the user interface, OpenAI's GPT model for generating content, and the Wikipedia API for gathering information. Here’s a breakdown of each component and how they work together:

Overview
The application aims to help users generate YouTube video titles and scripts based on a given topic. Users input a topic, and the app uses AI and Wikipedia data to generate a catchy title and a detailed script for a YouTube video.

Components and Functionality
Streamlit:

Purpose: Streamlit is used to create the interactive web interface for the app.
Key Features: It provides a title, image, and text input box where users can enter their video topic.
Display: Shows the generated title and script, along with a summary from Wikipedia.
OpenAI API:

Purpose: OpenAI’s GPT model generates creative content such as YouTube video titles and scripts based on the provided topic and additional context.
Key Features:
Generate YouTube Title: Creates a catchy and relevant title for the video based on the user’s topic.
Generate YouTube Script: Produces a script for the video, leveraging the title and additional information gathered from Wikipedia.
Wikipedia API:

Purpose: Provides relevant information about the topic from Wikipedia, which is used to enhance the script content.
Key Features:
Fetch Summary: Retrieves a summary of the topic to include factual and contextual information in the script.
Detailed Workflow
User Input:

The user provides a topic for the YouTube video via a text input box in the Streamlit app.
Generate Title:

The input topic is sent to OpenAI’s GPT model with a prompt to generate a catchy video title. The response is displayed in the app.
Fetch Wikipedia Summary:

The same topic is used to query Wikipedia for a summary. This summary provides context and factual information to enhance the video script.
Generate Script:

Using the generated title and the Wikipedia summary, OpenAI’s GPT model creates a detailed script for the YouTube video. This script includes the title and integrates information from the Wikipedia summary.
Display Results:

The app displays the generated video title and script on the web interface. It also shows the Wikipedia summary used to create the script.
